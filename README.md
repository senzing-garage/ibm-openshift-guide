# ibm-openshift-guide

If you are beginning your journey with
[Senzing](https://senzing.com/),
please start with
[Senzing Quick Start guides](https://docs.senzing.com/quickstart/).

You are in the **Senzing Garage** where projects are "tinkered" on.
Although this GitHub repository may help you understand an approach to using Senzing,
it's not considered to be "production ready" and is not considered to be part of the Senzing product.
Heck, they may not even be appropriate for your application of Senzing!

## Overview

This repository illustrates a reference implementation of
[Senzing](https://senzing.com) on
[IBM Cloud Pak for Data](https://www.ibm.com/products/cloud-pak-for-data).

The instructions show how to set up a system that:

1. Reads JSON lines from a file on the internet.
1. Sends each JSON line to a message queue.
1. Reads messages from the queue and inserts into Senzing.
1. Reads information from Senzing via [Senzing API Server](https://github.com/Senzing/senzing-api-server) server.
1. Views resolved entities in a [web app](https://github.com/Senzing/entity-search-web-app).

For more information, see
[Senzing Entity Resolution for IBM Cloud Pak for Data](https://senzing.com/cloud_pak_for_data).

The following diagram shows the relationship of the Helm charts, docker containers,
and code in this IBM Cloud Pak for Data reference implementation.
